          a deck from Shadows Over Innistrad Standard</a>
          that has a unique play style: it durdles, takes extra turns, casts
          a bunch of spells that don&rsquo;t seem to do much&hellip; and
          then it wins the game! Pioneer adds key cards that strengthen the
          core strategy of the deck and create additional &ldquo;hard
          locks&rdquo; that keep your opponent out of the game. The deck is
          fun to play, it can hold its own, and it&rsquo;ll surprise (but not
          delight) your opponents.

          It has been quite awhile since I have been as excited in something as I am the pioneer format. While the format is still in it's infancy and is volatile, I decided to renew an old favorite deck of mine with an updated twist!
        </p>
        <h2>Deck Tech</h2>
        <p>
          Mono Blue Prison is an old Standard deck that is truly unique in the way that it plays the game. It is the epitome of a deck that durdles until eventually you just win the game. Essentially, the goal of the deck is to get out a few Jace's Sanctum and storm off until we have bounced our opponents board, taken a few extra turns and have a few 6/6 lands or a horde of zombies, or your opponent concedes prematurely. With the release of War of the Spark, we have a new powerful Planeswalker for the deck, Narset, Parter of Veils . Down below, we will go over why this card pushed this deck even further in the competitive direction. The deck is fun, very strong, and it will take your opponent by surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of that being said, this deck is not for every body. If you enjoy storming off and playing solitaire for a few minutes at times, bouncing an entire board of creatures back into your opponent's hand and then having them discard all of them, then you are in for a treat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without further ado, let's break the deck down!
        </p>
        <h3>Key Cards</h3>
        <h4>
          <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/61/jaces-sanctum">
            Jace&rsquo;s Sanctum
          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This card is key for the deck. While it is heavy at 4 mana and we
            have to tap out for it, it will pay off almost instantaneously.
            Sanctum reduces the cost of our instants & sorceries which is dope,
            but more importantly is allows us to Scry 1 each time we cast a
            spell, filtering through our deck to find the pieces that we need.
            This is of utmost importance as this deck is heavily reliant on
            needing to find
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ddt/5/engulf-the-shore">
            Engulf the Shore</a>
            and
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m19/82/uncomfortable-chill">
            Uncomfortable Chill</a>
            to stay alive at times. Having multiple Sanctums out really allows
            you to filter through the deck greatly.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/235/prism-ring">
            Prism Ring
          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            A card that seems insignificant actually plays a very vital role in our deck. Prism Ring allows us to gain a metric fuck ton of life per match when we can get one or two out. A turn 1 Prism Ring is one of the best plays in the deck. Each spell we cast will be gaining us a life, and there will be turns where you gain 4-5 life. In a creature heavy format such as Pioneer is right now, the extra life gain is life saving. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/soi/58/engulf-the-shore">
            Engulf the Shore
          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our reason for staying mono blue with an island only mana base. Notably, this is not basic islands, so Mystic Sanctuary can be played without fail and helps us in the late game. Engulf absolutely destroys mid range strategies that rely on 3-4 CMC creatures to peck away at our life total. The majority of creatures in the format that are played are < 4 toughness, so Engulf is a great sweeper and absolutely obliterates token strategies. With our Narset lock, we can also return a board full of creatures to our opponents hand and make them discard them all. Note, this also returns your 6/6 elemental tokens, so be weary of the situation and when you are casting your spells.

          </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          This is the reason I have absolutely loved playing this deck and feel that it has been reinvigorated. There is a modern deck devoted to this combo that works fairly well though it is simply not quick enough for Modern.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combo is as such: Have Narset, Parter of Veils on the battlefield and utilize her static ability of "Each opponent can't draw more than one card per turn" by casting Day's Undoing , which allows you to discard your handle, shuffle your graveyard into your deck, and draw 7 cards. Meanwhile, for our opponent, they are discarding their hand, shuffling their graveyard into their deck, and drawing only 1 card as it is the first card they've drawn that turn. This is absolutely back breaking for a lot of decks in the format especially on turn 4-5 or after a big Engulf the Shore.
        </p>
        <h3>Finishers</h3>
        <p>
          We have 5 major finishers in our deck pre-board, 4 Part the Waterveil and 1 Rise from the Tides . Waterveil acts not only as a finisher but also as a way to get our combo going and extend some turns. Casting the Awaken cost allows us to create a few 6/6's, a big 12/12, or even an 18/18 if you manage to cast 3 with Awaken. As noted early, these can be bounced with Engulf the Shores and you won't get your card back, so be careful and sequence your lines right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rise from the Tides on the other hand floods the board with Zombies en masse. Casting Rise followed by Day's Undoing is great and allows you to get back your rise and begin to fill your yard back up. It's a neat little recursion, and Mystic Sanctuary allows us to get Rise back as well. You can definitely clear the board with a few Engulf's and then flood the board with Zombies. 
        </p>
        <h3>Sideboard</h3>
        <p>
            Our sideboard will always be fluctuating, especially with how early Pioneer is right now. My recommendations for sure for this deck are going to be Grafdigger's Cage for all of the CoCo and graveyard strats. Collected Company is going to be huge in this format, so Cage shuts that down completely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thing in the Ice  Flip will be very vital here as well. It's a brick wall against aggro and is a one sided board wipe in the later game and can act as a finisher. TiTi is great against control as well because they'll most likely side out removal against you, which allows TiTi to shine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pithing Needle shuts down a lot of Planeswalkers and Marvel, so it's a must have right now for a deck that has difficulty dealing with those things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Negate is negate. You're in blue, play Negate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sideboard varies depending on the meta, of course. 
        </p>
      <h2>Sideboard Guide</h2>
      <h3>Aggro</h3>
      <p>
        First and foremost, the deck struggles with hyper aggressive strategies. Even though we have pseudo-sweepers and fogs, we will still get run over by a quick curve. Mono Red & White Weenies could be potential strategies in Pioneer, so we will have cross our fingers and hope our midrange overlords will reign supreme. As a general sideboard guide against aggro, I would do:

        We want to drop the amount of high cost spells here and bring in our TiTi and pray we stone wall them and get some an early Prism Ring. Aggro will be a tough match up and is certainly unfavored, but we can still manage wins here and there. 
      </p>
      </p>
      <h3>Midrange</h3>
      <p>
          There are a variety of midrange strategies going around right now and this is very hard to side board for simply because no one knows how the format will shape up and which decks will become top tier. Regardless, since we are playing against a creature strategy, we know what we are bringing in, and sideboarding out depends on the deck. Generally I feel that most midrange strategies are favorable for us as they tend to not attack us so quickly and allow us get our field set up well before we're so far ahead they will struggle to come back. I anticipate a lot of CoCo decks and Abzan featuring Siege Rhino, so against those types of decks I will be doing:

          I like bringing in Gearhulk here to brick some late game blockers and also act as a surprise attack. Fatcaster mage is also great at bringing back our Engulf / cantrips. TiTi is a blocker, and Cage will always come in against CoCo and Needle will hit our Planeswalkers and Marvel. 
      </p>
      <h3>Control</h3>
      <p>
        This will entirely depend upon the flavor of control we are facing against. There is not a wide array of good counterspells in the format, but there are enough that will make it challenging for us at times to land our spells on time. Game 1 against a control deck will be a long and tiresome match, like most control mirrors do. I honestly have no idea what kind of control decks are in the format right now, but I assume UW Approach / UW Draw-Go and Esper Dragons could be big players. Regardless, a tentative control guide will be:
      </p>
      <p>
        OUT: -3 Engulf the Shore, -3 Uncomfortable Chill, -4 Prism Ring
      </p>
      <p>
        IN: +4 Negate, +4 TiTi, +2 Gearhulk, +1 Azcanta, +1 Needle
      </p>
      <p>
        Against control we are going to remove our Engulf's and our fogs. Prism Ring doesn't do a whole lot here for us either, so we will be cutting these. We will be bringing in all of our Negate, all of our TiTi, an Azcanta because these games will be long and grindy, and our gearhulks. The needle will come in most times to shut off any walkers are will be experiencing.
      </p>
      <h3>Combo</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, so this is mainly for the Jeskai Ascendancy decks. I feel very comfortable playing against these decks as we can disrupt them fairly well with Shore, Narset prevents the card draw to stop the filtering, and Day's Undoing will shut off their yard, depending if they are rocking the Emry combo. Narset really fucks with this deck, so main boarding 4 of them is a super help. Regardless, as a tentative guide:
      </p>
      <p>
        OUT: -4 Prism Ring, -3 Uncomfortable Chill, -1 Rise from the Tides
      </p>
      <p>
        IN: +4 Negate, +4 TiTi
      </p>
      <p>
        Bringing in TiTi to block and possibly reset the board, and Negate will stop the Ascendancy. Pretty basic match up as our main board is pretty tight against them.
      </p>
      <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
      <p>
        And for the most part, that is the deck! Please note that I don't believe this will ever be a Tier 0 deck, but this is definitely a deck that will meta game hard. I am loving Day's Undoing in the current meta because there is a ton of Delirium, Jace, Vyn's Prodigy, dredge based decks, and ultimately a decent amount of decks that rely on the graveyard. Undoing acts as mainboard graveyard hate that also coincidentally works as part of our combo. I have truly enjoyed playing this deck as it feels rewarding when you fight your way out of a shitty situation and storm off like High Tide does in Legacy. Part of me wants to add in a singleton Aetherflux Reservoir because there are quite a few times where I'm above 50 life and it could be ended right then and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you all think of the deck? Please give me all of your criticism, card ideas, and any discussion at all is very welcomed.

        If you've made it this far, thank you for reading and I hope you have enjoyed the deck tech!
