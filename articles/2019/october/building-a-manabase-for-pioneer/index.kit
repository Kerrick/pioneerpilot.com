<!-- $title-full: Building A Manabase For Pioneer -->
<!-- $title-trimmed: Building A Manabase -->
<!-- $summary:  Pioneerâ€™s initial ban list only includes five cards: the fetch
lands. What does this mean for building a manabase? In this article we explore
the multi-color lands available in the format, the best specialty mono-color
lands, and what utility lands you might consider including. Does banning the
fetch lands prevent three- and four-color decks like Wizards hopes?
