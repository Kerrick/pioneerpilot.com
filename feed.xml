        Pioneer&#8217;s initial ban list only includes five cards: the
        <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=banned%3Apioneer">fetch
        lands</a>. What does this mean for building a manabase? In this
        article we explore the multi-color lands available in the format,
        the best specialty mono-color lands, and what utility lands you
        might consider including. Does banning the fetch lands prevent
        three- and four-color decks like Wizards hopes?

        As explained in their official blog post, Wizards of the Coast
        announced a new format today: Pioneer. Like Modern, the Pioneer
        format does not rotate, and includes cards that have been in
        standard since a certain set. But unlike Modern, it starts at
        Return to Ravnica, leaving a much smaller card pool to work with.
        What does this mean for your old Standard decks? How does mana work
        in this format? All this and more in PioneerPilot.com&#8217;s first
        article.
