            Pioneer should be a sweet spot for brewing sweet decks around powerful
            or unique cards. Because it&rsquo;s smaller than Modern your brews
            don&rsquo;t have to compete with incredibly streamlined and brutal
            decks. But because it&rsquo;s larger than standard, unique strategies
            tend to have more support cards available to make things run smoothly.
            In this article we look at five build-around blue cards that can
            inspire your next Pioneer brew.

              Mono Blue Prison is a deck from Shadows Over Innistrad Standard
              that has a unique play style: it durdles, takes extra turns, casts
              a bunch of spells that don&rsquo;t seem to do much&hellip; and
              then it wins the game! Pioneer adds key cards that strengthen the
              core strategy of the deck and create additional &ldquo;hard
              locks&rdquo; that keep your opponent out of the game. The deck is
              fun to play, it can hold its own, and it&rsquo;ll surprise (but not
              delight) your opponents.

            Pioneer&rsquo;s initial ban list only includes five cards: the
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=banned%3Apioneer">fetch
            lands</a>. What does this mean for building a manabase? In this
            article we explore the multi-color lands available in the format,
            the best specialty mono-color lands, and what utility lands you
            might consider including. Does banning the fetch lands prevent
            three- and four-color decks like Wizards hopes?

            Wizards of the Coast's Aaron Forsythe announced today in a tweet
            that Pioneer will see weekly Banned & Restricted List updates,
            rather than the &ldquo;any time&rdquo; schedule they had before.
            Forsythe cites the quick adoption of the format for FNMs and weekend
            tournaments, likely including the SCG Player's Championship. In order
            to give players the most time to plan their weekend deck lists, the
            updates will be posted on Mondays.

            Citing reduced player interest in the Standard format, SCG is
            making a change to their annual invitational Players' Championship
            at SCG CON next month. Rather than being Modern and Standard, the
            format will now be Standard and Pioneer!

            As explained in their official blog post, Wizards of the Coast
            announced a new format today: Pioneer. Like Modern, the Pioneer
            format does not rotate, and includes cards that have been in
            standard since a certain set. But unlike Modern, it starts at
            Return to Ravnica, leaving a much smaller card pool to work with.
            What does this mean for your old Standard decks? How does mana work
            in this format? All this and more!
