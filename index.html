            Pioneer should be a sweet spot for brewing sweet decks around powerful
            or unique cards. Because it&rsquo;s smaller than Modern your brews
            don&rsquo;t have to compete with incredibly streamlined and brutal
            decks. But because it&rsquo;s larger than standard, unique strategies
            tend to have more support cards available to make things run smoothly.
            In this article we look at five build-around blue cards that can
            inspire your next Pioneer brew.

              Mono Blue Prison is a deck from Shadows Over Innistrad Standard
              that has a unique play style: it durdles, takes extra turns, casts
              a bunch of spells that don&rsquo;t seem to do much&hellip; and
              then it wins the game! Pioneer adds key cards that strengthen the
              core strategy of the deck and create additional &ldquo;hard
              locks&rdquo; that keep your opponent out of the game. The deck is
              fun to play, it can hold its own, and it&rsquo;ll surprise (but not
              delight) your opponents.

            Pioneer&rsquo;s initial ban list only includes five cards: the
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=banned%3Apioneer">fetch
            lands</a>. What does this mean for building a manabase? In this
            article we explore the multi-color lands available in the format,
            the best specialty mono-color lands, and what utility lands you
            might consider including. Does banning the fetch lands prevent
            three- and four-color decks like Wizards hopes?

            As explained in their official blog post, Wizards of the Coast
            announced a new format today: Pioneer. Like Modern, the Pioneer
            format does not rotate, and includes cards that have been in
            standard since a certain set. But unlike Modern, it starts at
            Return to Ravnica, leaving a much smaller card pool to work with.
            What does this mean for your old Standard decks? How does mana work
            in this format? All this and more in PioneerPilot.com&rsquo;s first
            article.
